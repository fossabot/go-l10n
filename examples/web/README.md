This example application demonstrates the approach to
localization web-based Go applications, with the following
properties:

 1. Display language is determined from the browser
 2. Display language can be overridden by a cooke and/or query parameter
 3. Localization is stored in native Go files ([string] string maps)
    and is compiled with the application
 4. You can provide developer comments for each
    translatable entity
 5. Localization files are generated by
    [Serge](https://github.com/evernote/serge); generated .po files
    are used to provide translation (you can do a continuous
    localization of your project)
 6. Formatting (named placeholders, support for plurals/conditionals)
    is provided by [Plurr](https://github.com/iafan/Plurr) library
 7. Support for inserting localized strings and string formatting in
    `html/template`-based templates
 8. Automatic generation of pseudotranslated resources for quick testing

See [.serge](.serge/) subfolder for an additional README on the localization workflow.

Running
-------

Use `./build.sh` script to build the binary, then run `./server` and go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the page in your preferred language.
To change the display language, use the links in the footer of the demo page.
When language is not set explicitly, it is detected from your browser settings.
